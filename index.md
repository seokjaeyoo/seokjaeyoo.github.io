Welcome to the Quantum Nano-Optics Group. We explore novel physics in low dimensional systems and other condensed matters using a nano-optics approach. We perform both experimental and theoretical studies for our projects. Please find [research](research) for details.

We're recruiting graduate students and postdocs. We pursue a democratic and social lab environment rather than a hierarchical environemnt. Please find [our lab manual](https://github.com/seokjaeyoo/quantum-nano-optics-group/blob/main/20210827_group-manual_v1.pdf) for our efforts to a lab culture.

We also welcome undergraduate internship. Feel free to reach out to Prof. Yoo if interested.

- **Open Office** : No appointment is required. Any topics are welcome. Details for Open Office are described in [this post](https://seokjaeyoo.github.io//2021/07/14/openoffice.html). In Spring semester 2022, Open Office hours are 15:00~17:00 (Mon) and 13:00~15:00 (Thu).
