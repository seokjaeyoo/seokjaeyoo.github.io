Welcome to the Quantum Nano-Optics Group. We explore novel physics in low dimensional systems and other condensed matters using a nano-optics approach. We perform both experimental and theoretical studies for our projects. Please find [research] for details.

We're recruiting graduate students and postdocs. We pursue a democratic and social lab environment rather than a hierarchical atmosphere. Please find [our lab manual](link) for our efforts to a lab culture.
