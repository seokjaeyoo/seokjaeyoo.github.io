## Research Interest
#### Light-matter Interaction in quantum systems
We explore novel physics on the light-matter interaction in quantum systems including low-dimensional condensed matter. Low dimensional materials exhibits strong light-matter interaction even though they have atomic thicknesses. They also possess exotic and novel qunatum properties that cannot be found in their higher dimensional counterparts.
#### Quantum Plasmonics
Quantum systems such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, and grain boundaries in 2D TMDs can support surface plasmons, a collective oscillation of electrons at the metallic surface. Such quantum plasmons exhibit unique properties that cannot be found in classical plasmons of noble metals. We study the novel properties of quantum plasmons and their nanophotonic application.

## Techniques
#### Experiments
We develop polarimetric spectroscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry to study dielectric, excitonic, and plasmonic properties of low dimensional materials.
We also plan to establish the infrared scattering near-field optical microscopy (IR SNOM) in the near future. IR SNOM enables to study infrared quantum plasmons in graphene and carbon nanotubes.

#### Theory
We also perform theoretical studies for low-dimensional physics. We apply a semi-classical electromagnetic theory and a quantum mechanical theory to nanophotonic and low-dimensional problems. We also perform numerical simulations from electromagnetics to phononic mechanics.
